		<h1>Is This Why I'm Single?</h1>
		<h2>Musings from my perpetually single soul.</h2>
		<p>Hi there! I'm Tricia. Please join me as I delve into the depths of singledom. I've lived in Dallas, KC, Atlanta, Shanghai, Barcelona, San Diego, and India. I have dated everyone, including your uncle's sister-in-law's cousin's potted plant's gardener. As a result, I have stories to share! Thanks for joining me on my journey.</p>
